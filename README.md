# 👋 Hi there, I'm Chandana Gadela!

### Data Enthusiast | Problem Solver | Storyteller  
I transform raw data into actionable insights, weaving stories with numbers and creating solutions that drive efficiency and decision-making. With over 5 years of experience in data analytics, visualization, and automation, I’m always looking for the next challenge to tackle.

Currently, I’m diving into machine learning, cloud technologies, and building automated data pipelines to enhance operational efficiency. When I’m not working, I’m either baking delicious treats or planning my next  vacation!
